Halite
======

(Code-name) Halite is a Salt GUI. Status is pre-alpha. Contributions are
very welcome. Join us in #salt-devel on Freenode or on the salt-users mailing
list.

This is version 0.0.3 which is substantially changed from the previous version.
Any application based on the previous version will be broken.

This version is substantially different. Notable changes include:
1. Use of a new unified api in salt/client/api.py for talking to salt.
   Does not use Salt-API. The rest service is integral to halite.
2. Use of Server Sent Events (SSE) to receive realtime streaming of events 
  from the Salt Event Bus.
3. Use of Bottle web framework included with choice of WSGI web servers. The server must
  be multithreaded or gevented or the equivalent in order to support SSE. The tested
  servers are paste, cherrypy, and gevent
4. Simplified web API that is a thin wrapper around salt/client/api.py

This version of Halite is meant to work out of the box with an install option for 
SaltStack. The PyPi  (PIP) version of Halite is a minified version that is meant
to be installed along side Salt to provide a minimal out of the box UI for Salt.

The repository is meant for development of custom versions of the UI that would
be deployed with different servers, different configurations, etc and for development
of future features for the Salt packaged version.

Installation quickstart
